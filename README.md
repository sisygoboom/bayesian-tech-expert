# Bayesian tech expert
A bayes theorem based expert system that can guess a technology (could be hardware or software) based on your answers to questions.

## Requirements
- Docker
- yarn

## Useage
###Quickstart
- `chmod +x run.sh`
- `./run.sh build`
- Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.
- Think of a technology and the beyesian tech expert will attempt to guess what it is by asking questions.
- If the expert gets it wrong, you may add additional questions, add a new technology or restart the game.

*If run.sh fails or you are unable to run it, you must follow the following manual steps:
- (optional) `yarn build` in the /ui directory, then copy files in /ui/build to /services/web/project/static
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d` in the projects root directory
- `docker-compose exec web python manage.py create_db` then `docker-compose exec web python manage.py seed_db` to initialise and populate the DB*

### Accessing the DB

To ssh into the db container execute:
`./run.sh db`
or
`docker-compose exec db psql --username=hello_flask --dbname=hello_flask_prod`

Once in, `\c` to connect.

`\dt` to list tables.

Write regular SQL to view rows.

`\q` to quit.

### Rebuild and restart containers without deleting db changes (static files won't be updated)
`./run.sh restart`

### View logs
`./run.sh logs`
