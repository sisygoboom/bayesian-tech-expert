# Bayesian tech expert
A bayes theorem based expert system that can guess a technology (could be hardware or software) based on your answers to questions.

## Requirements
- Docker
- yarn

## Useage
- `chmod +x run.sh`
- `./run.sh`
- Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.
- Think of a technology and the beyesian tech expert will attempt to guess what it is by asking questions.
- If the expert gets it wrong, you may add additional questions, add a new technology or restart the game.

*If run.sh fails or you are unable to run it, you must follow the following manual steps:*
- *(optional) `yarn build` in the /ui directory, then copy files in /ui/build to /services/web/project/static*
- *`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d` in the projects root directory*
- *`docker-compose exec web python manage.py create_db` then `docker-compose exec web python manage.py seed_db` to initialise and populate the DB*
