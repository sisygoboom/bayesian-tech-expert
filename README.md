# Bayesian tech expert
A bayes theorem based expert system that can guess a technology (could be hardware or software) based on your answers to questions.

## Requirements
- python 3
- numpy

## Useage
Simply run the script, think of a technology (either from the list below or a new one you want to add) and answer the questions - 0 for no, 0.25 for probably not, 0.5 for "not apliccable"/"don't know", 0.75 for probably and 1 for yes.
It will then proceed to make a predictions. If the prediction is worng you can either add a new question or add a new technology.
